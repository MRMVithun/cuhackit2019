# cuhackit2019

Jupyter Notebook for the "Intro to Data Science/Machine Learning with Python" session at CUhackit 2019.

To run this notebook, go to [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), select the "Github" tab, and search for the __ctargon/cuhackit2019__ repository. You should see the notebook appear. Once you open a notebook you can save a copy of it to Google Drive. You may also need to go to “Edit” > “Notebook settings” to change the runtime to Python 3 and to use a GPU if you need it. Otherwise, it just works!
